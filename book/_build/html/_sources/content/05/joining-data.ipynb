    "Adding additional attributes to an existing dataset is often necessary to improve the description of the data generating process and answer the questions being asked of the data. In its most simple form, such a task consists of tables of the same individuals, with different attributes, collected for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a process simply needs to add the columns of the second table to the first table. However, this process only works when the rows of the two tables correspond to the same individuals. Assuming a one-to-one correspondence between the individuals in the two tables, identified by their index, combining the columns of the two tables requires two steps:\n",
    "* sorting each table by their respective indexes (i.e. lining them up),\n",
    "* iterating through the (common) index of each table, combining the attributes of each row into a new table.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1:* This procedure is implicitly done by Pandas whenever setting a Series as a new column of an existing DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* Understanding the internals of this procedure is important for both being able to debug performance issues, as well as implement custom procedures when the correspondence between the rows of the tables is not obvious.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure is known as **joining** or **merging** tables (column-wise). The correspondence between the rows (e.g. via a shared index) is called a **join key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Below, two tables contain characteristics of California counties obtained from the [US Census](http://factfinder2.census.gov/): one contains a population attribute, the other contains the median household income. The join key is the 'County' column.\n",

    "Pandas has multiple ways of executing a (column-wise) join of DataFrames. Below outlines each and their relative advantages. In spite of the options, one should use the `merge` method whenever possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Join Technique 1: column(s) assignment** The most simple way of joining the columns of two tables along a shared index is by column(s) assignment. If `df1` and `df2` have indexes in one-to-one correspondence, they can be joined via:\n",
    "```\n",
    "df1[df2.columns] = df2\n",
    "```\n",
    "This technique is simple and space efficient, since column assignment modifies the left-hand DataFrame in-place. However it has many disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Advantages|Disadvantages|\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "|Space Efficient|Doesn't work with the method chaining|\n",
    "|---|Joining more than two DataFrames requires multiple lines|\n",
    "|---|Works only when indexes are in one-to-one correspondence|\n",
    "|---|Sorts the two DataFrames by index, even if already aligned|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Join Technique 2 (`concat`):** The Pandas function `concat` column-wise joins a list of DataFrames by a shared index, with several convenient keyword arguments. If `df1,...,dfN` are DataFrames, then the columns of these DataFrames can be joined by passing them to `concat` in a list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pd.concat([df1, ..., dfN], axis=1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function has many advantages over column assignment:\n",

    "|Can easily join many DataFrames|Doesn't work with method chaining|\n",
    "|Indexes don't need to be 1-1 correspondence|The DataFrames must of a common index|\n",
    "|Can skip sorting indexes by setting `ignore_index=True`||\n",
    "\n",
    "**Join Technique 3 (`merge`):** The `merge` method is the most flexible joining technique in Pandas. By default, it joins the columns of two DataFrames on common columns. If `df1,...,dfN` are DataFrames with shared columns that identify observations between them, the DataFrames can be joined by chaining together successive `merge` calls:\n",
    "```\n",
    "df1.merge(df2).merge(df3)...merge(dfN)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the DataFrames have a shared index, then `merge` is called with the `left_index/right_index=True` keyword argument.\n",
