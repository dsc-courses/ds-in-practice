    "The proportion of employees not in the SSA data is 3.5%, which is fairly small, but may affect the results. These individuals should be investigated more closely; a look at the employees with a gender assigned versus those that didn't appear in the SSA names dataset reveals some bias (see table below). \n",

    "Perhaps those that didn't appear in the names dataset have lower salaries because they belong to an uncommon ethnic group (e.g. an immigrant group)? Such populations would likely work in jobs that earn lower salaries. One could further clean up these missing genders by incorporating the demographic information from immigration data.\n",
